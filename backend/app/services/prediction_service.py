"""
Orchestrates the full SolSight inference pipeline:

  Image + Operational Data
        │
        ▼
  CNN  ──► defect label, confidence, 128-d feature vector
        │
        ▼
  MLP  ──► Healthy / Warning / Critical + health_score
        │
        ▼
  Bi-LSTM (uses this panel's historical health_scores) ──► 30/60/90 day forecast
        │
        ▼
  Maintenance recommendation (status + defect + forecast)

Each stage only uses its network if trained weights were found in
saved_models/. Otherwise it falls back to the physics/rule-based logic in
diagnostics.py, and the response says which path was taken
(`analysis_mode`) so nobody mistakes an estimate for a model output.
